# Rogout

An another logout tool for wayland (maybe)

## Goals

- No goals

## Wayland?

I test it only in hyprland with next rules:

```hyprlang
windowrulev2 = fullscreenstate:client 3, class:^(Rogout)$
```

Well....

## Installation

- Clone repo
- Install rust
- Install nodejs
- Run `npm run tauri build --no-bundle`
- Run `cp ./src-tauri/target/release/rogout /usr/bin`
- Use it in your favourite toolbar as `rogout`

## Crossplatform?

- Maybe no, I doesn't test

## Contributions

You can make pullrequests and I'll check it
